abstract="A recent calculation, in the weak-noise limit, of the rate of escape of a particle over a one-dimensional potential barrier is extended by including an inertial term in the Langevin equation. Specifically, we consider a system described by the Langevin equation{\$}{\$}m{\backslash}ddot x + {\backslash}dot x + V{\backslash}prime (x) = {\backslash}xi {\$}{\$}, where$\xi$ is a Gaussian colored noise with mean zero and correlator {\textlangle}$\xi$(t)$\xi$(t'){\textrangle}=(D/$\tau$)exp(−|t−t'|/$\tau$). A pathintegral formulation is augmented by a steepest descent calculation valid in the weak-noise (D{\textrightarrow}0) limit. This yields an escape rate$\Gamma$∼exp(−S/D), where the ``action''S is the minimum, over paths characterizing escape over the barrier, of a generalized Onsager-Machlup functional, the extremal path being an ``instanton'' of the theory. The extremal actionS is calculated analytically for smallm and$\tau$ for general potentials, and numerical results forS are displayed for various ranges ofm and$\tau$ for the typical case of the quartic potentialV(x)=−x2/2+x4/4.",
