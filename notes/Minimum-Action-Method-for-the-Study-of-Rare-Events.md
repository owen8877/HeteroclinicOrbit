# Notes on [_Minimum Action Method for the Study of Rare Events_](http://www.cims.nyu.edu/~eve2/mam.pdf)
## Background
- Theory of Wentzell and Freidlin - Action Functional
- Gradient Systems - _MEP_ is fully solved
## Theory of Wentzell and Freidlin
- The probability of a path is approximate to `exp(-S/e)`, where S is the instaton.
## Application to 1-D Ginzburg-Landau Model
## ... 2-D
## For nongradient systems
- example of Brusselator
